                                    work with these technologies on a daily basis, and I also have loads of

                                    projects
                                    to demonstrate that knowledge. Working hard is very much a part of my personal
                                    identity. I
                                    love my pace of life and would bring all the interpersonal and time management
                                    skills that
                                    are such a core part of my work life to this role.

                                    I imagine a project and draw it on the paper and implement with the help of
                                    HTML,
                                    CSS and
                                    JS. I remember when I made my first website, I was so excited about couldn’t
                                    stop
                                    clicking
                                    that button and since then I didn’t look back and kept on working on my skills
                                    and
                                    understanding of web development and web designing.

            <p>My zeal to learn more and more brought me always on a bigger challenge, be it my academic
                  days or
                  professional days. First job in a BPO, I had to make new clients for company called
                  “Optus”
                  (Australia). I remember making 4-5 sales/contracts every day. Then I worked for
                  “TRueEnergy”
                  (Australia), again here I was responsible for making new customers. Then I moved to an IT
                  company as a
                  customer support (UK shift). I used to advice and answer people on their specific issues
                  while
                  using
                  company’s app but I was always attracted by the geeks inside the tech room.

                  <br>
                  My journey started watching online tutorials on making websites, I picked up with,
                  WordPress,
                  Woo-commerce, Magento, OpenCart. I did digital marketing course where I learned the ways
                  of
                  digital
                  marketing. Then I started to learn different kinds of plugins and page builders like DIvi,
                  Elementor,
                  Visual composer, cornerstone etc.
